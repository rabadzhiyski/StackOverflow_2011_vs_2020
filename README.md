# What has changed for a decade?

This is a repository related to StackOverflow development survey of 2011 and 2012. With some exploratory data analyses we answer three questions:
- What were the most popular languages in 2011 and now?
- What were the top 10 countries in 2011 and now?
- Did Linux and Mac OS win the fight against Microsoft?

### The repository contains the following:
 - StackOverflow Survey 2011 vs 2020.ipnb (doc containing the python code)
 - 2011_survey_results_public.csv (source file with data for 2011). Stack Overflow 2011 Survey Results - rows: 2814  columns: 65
 - 2020_survey_results_public.zip (source file with data for 2020). Stack Overflow 2020 Survey Results - rows: 64461  columns: 61 
 - 2020_survey_results_schema.csv (source companion file with data for 2020). Stack Overflow 2020 Survey Question schema.

 
 ### Libraries used
 - numpy and pandas
 - matplotlib
 - seaborn
 - plotly
 
 ### Summary
A lot of things happened for ten years but according to the StackOverflow survey results we could capture a few insights.
- Web development languages were the most popular within the programming world for the last decade.Â 
- StackOverflow expanded its impact beyond just US and Europe. India was the country which showed tremendous growth in its presence for the last ten years.
- Windows is still the most preferred operating system but it is in constant decline. Linux, and especially Mac OS, were the winners of the last decade.
